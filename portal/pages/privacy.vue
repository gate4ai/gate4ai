              We collect only the minimum necessary data (email, API call logs,
              technical metadata). Anonymous metrics are collected to analyze
              service usage. Passwords are not stored â€“ we use OAuth or hashing
              instead.

            <h2 class="text-h5 mb-3">Use of Data</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Data is used only for technical support and service analysis. We
              do not sell user data to third parties.

            <h2 class="text-h5 mb-3">Data Storage</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Logs are stored only for technical necessity. Users can request
              the deletion of their data.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-h5 mb-3">Security</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Standard security measures are in place, but 100% security is not
              guaranteed.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-h5 mb-3">Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Personal data is not shared with third parties, except as required
              by law. API requests may pass through external API-servers, for
              whose security we are not responsible.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-h5 mb-3">Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The policy may change without notice. The user is responsible for
              reviewing updates.
